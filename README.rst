A small gui to keep notes on stuff I watch or read.
Install using pip install . in the folder.
A csv file containing note information gets created with the first note.
A PDF containing all the notes with clean layout is saved upon exiting.
Default path is ~/notes_on_stuff.pdf. When set, the path is saved and re used evey time so that the pdf gets updated.

I removed the tests for the application is too basic and testing tkinter too complicated.
